## About the Zetta tutorials

### How to use the tutorials

The Zetta tutorials and complete source code for each tutorial are in GitHub. To get started, we recommend you clone or download the zettajs-tutorials repository. 

Each tutorial project follows this basic structure, where the text of the tutorial is in the README:

```
/zettajs-tutorials/<name>
    - README.md
    - ./device.js
    - ./scout.js
    - ./index.js
    - ./package.json
```

### Install Node.js and npm

You need to have Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you do not have this software, follow these steps:

Go to the [Node.js download site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the installation instructions for your system. The download installs both Node.js and NPM.

Verify that the `node` and `npm` commands are in your path:

```bash
  node -v
    <installed version number>
      
  npm -v
    <installed version number>
```
